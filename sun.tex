Melodie: ``Seasons in the Sun''\\
Text: Stony
\end{songinfo}

\X{C}Goodby to you my trusted friend\\
I programmed you since I was n\X{dm}ine or ten\\
\X{G7}Together we solved dungeon pl\X{C}ays\\
Hacked for cheatmodes many d\X{G}ays,\\
Played the hero in the m\X{C}ace

\Xvspace

Goodby to you, your time is gone\\
For my girl is jealous of my Sun\\
So I have to sell you now\\
I will miss you don´t you know,\\
And enclosed: you are too slow

\Xvspace

\textbf{Refrain:}\\
\X{C}We had joysticks, we had fun,\\
We had s\X{dm}essions at the Sun\\
All the d\X{G7}ay, all the night\\
We hacked on for our del\X{C}ight

My \X{C}PC was my best,\\
All I n\X{dm}eed´ to stand the rest\\
Was a c\X{G7}offee and a coke\\
And some cigarettes for the sm\X{C}oke

\Xvspace

I could read hex-code like a book\\
I lived from pizza for I couldn´t cook\\
My fractal programm was the best\\
At the CT-programm-test\\
I did outclass all the rest

\textit{Refrainmelodie:}\\
Then one day I decide\\
There is something else outside\\
But my first prob´(lem) in real,\\
There´s no manpage for "`girl"'

So trial and error was my plan,\\
And there soon I stood again:\\
'Cause my second prob´ in real\\
There´s no debugger for "`girl"'

And then one day I felt in love,\\
Something computers do not know enough\\
No AMIGA and no Cray\\
Could at least keep me away\\ 
At her side I had to stay.

So she showed me the world outside,\\
We sat together at low candlelight,\\
I had to promise her that day,\\
That I´ll give my Sun away,\\
otherwise she wouldn´t stay.

\textbf{Refrain:}\\
We had joysticks, we had fun,\\
We had sessions at the Sun\\
All the day, all the night\\
We hacked on for our delight

My PC was my best,\\
All I need´ to stand the rest\\
Was a coffee and a coke\\
And some cigarettes for the smoke

Goodby to you my good old Sun\\
I really now I owe you ´lot of fun\\
But parting does not hurt a lot,\\
For allready I have bought\\
A faster station than I'd got.

\textbf{Refrain:}\\
We had joysticks, we had fun,\\
We had sessions at the Sun\\
All the day, all the night\\
We hacked on for our delight
